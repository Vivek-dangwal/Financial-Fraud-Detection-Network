 🛡️ Financial Fraud Detection using Graph Theory

📌 Project Overview
Traditional fraud detection looks at single transactions. This project uses Network Analysis to find Synthetic Identities and fraud rings by analyzing the relationships between accounts.

  Key Features
- Network Mapping: Visualizes connections between 50+ financial accounts.
- Fraud Scoring: Uses 'Degree Centrality' math to find "Hubs" used for money laundering.
- Automated Reporting: Generates a 'High Risk' suspect list in CSV format.

 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python (Programming Language)
- NetworkX (Graph Theory & Analytics)
- Plotly (Interactive Data Visualization)
- Pandas (Data Manipulation)

 📊 Results
Successfully identified the top 5 most suspicious accounts based on connection density, providing a targeted list for forensic investigators.
